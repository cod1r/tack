a core part of tack's ui lib is that references are guaranteed to be kept.

for example:
    a box created by the user of the lib should live throughout the duration
    of the program and never be destroyed.

    The reason why it is implemented in that way is because it makes it easy
    for consumers of the lib to pass in an update function and use references to other
    boxes to grab whatever necessary information in order to render whatever that needs to be
    rendered.

    And if references are broken, proper updates won't be rendered and user provided logic
    basically won't run.
